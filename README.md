# PCoder
 A Pcoder for humanitarians

 This document reviews how pcodes can be added to .geojson files by fuzzy matching admin names. Sometimes admin names go by different spellings or have errors. With this process we review matches and attach pcodes between the spatial dataset and pcode dataset even if they are slightly different. By attaching pcodes to spatial data, we can visual humanitarian data without having to worry about different spelling of location names.

 This is meant to be a rough guide to use as a reference.
